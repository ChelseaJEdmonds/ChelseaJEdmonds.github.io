		<!-- About Bio Start -->
        <div id="about_bio">
            <p>Born in New York, out east on Long Island in the 50â€™s, I had nothing but forest from my back door, as far as the eye could see. This was our playground and we spent hours exploring and playing Tarzan. After school and on the weekends, it was my dog and I seeking out small animals, wild blueberries, and whatever we could find. This is where my love for nature comes from.
            </p>
            <p>From as far back as I can remember I spent time drawing with paper and pencil at home. This I believe is where my ability to see and translate to paper comes from. In Elementary school and throughout Junior High school my teachers had me decorate their bulletin boards and classroom walls. When my drawings were hung somewhere in the building, I never got them back, but that was ok with me, because I was proud to contribute to the school. An Art teacher that I had in the 5th grade cried when she saw a drawing that I did of President Lincoln. She said it was like I knew the man.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, as a Senior in High school with an open period that needed to be filled, I took an art class which I really enjoyed doing. That Spring, before graduation, I was called down to the auditorium for the awards given out to Seniors. I had no idea why but there was a seat on the stage for me with other students. To my surprise, my name was called, and I was given the Senior award for Art.
            </p>
            <p>As time went on, I got away from art, and was more focused on my career in the chemical field.  But then, a few years ago I decided to pick up the paint brush once again.  Now I wonder why I ever stopped.  Painting is my passion, and I am happy to show my work off to the world.  
            </p>
